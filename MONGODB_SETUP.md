# MongoDB Atlas Setup - Finding the Free Tier

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Click the "+ Create" Button
On the page you're seeing (Project Overview), click the green **"+ Create"** button.

### Step 2: Look for "Build a Database" or "Deploy a Cloud Database"
After clicking Create, you'll see options. Look for:
- **"Build a Database"** button, OR
- **"Deploy a Cloud Database"** option

### Step 3: Select the Free Tier
On the next screen, you'll see cluster type options:
- **"M0 FREE"** or **"Free"** - This is what you want!
- It might be labeled as "Shared" with "Free" underneath
- Look for the option that says "$0/month" or "Free Forever"

### Step 4: If You Don't See Free Option

**Option A: Try "Build a Database" from the sidebar**
- Look at the left sidebar
- Click **"Database"** → **"Build a Database"**
- The free tier should appear there

**Option B: Check if you need to verify your account**
- Some accounts need email verification first
- Check your email for a verification link from MongoDB

**Option C: The free tier might be in a different location**
- Sometimes it's under "Shared" cluster type
- Look for the cheapest option (should be $0/month)

### Step 5: After Selecting Free Tier
1. Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure - doesn't matter for free)
2. Choose a region (pick one close to you)
3. Give your cluster a name (or use default "Cluster0")
4. Click **"Create Cluster"** (takes 1-3 minutes)

## What the Free Tier Looks Like
- Usually labeled as **"M0"** or **"Free"**
- Shows **"$0.00/month"** or **"Free Forever"**
- Has limited storage (512MB) - perfect for demos!

## Still Can't Find It?

If you still can't see the free option:
1. Make sure you're logged into your MongoDB account
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Try accessing: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
4. Look for "Create" or "New Project" in the top navigation

The free tier is definitely available - it's just sometimes hidden in the UI flow!
